# BFF Security Assessment 

BFFs are implemented to do X, Y and Z. One critical aspect of BFFs is to ensure that the introduction of the BFF does not introduce security risks of its own. 

## Starting out

Starting out on this quest, lets first review some common flaws observed previously. 

## Identifying the classical suspects

Now, we're going to identify the classical suspects. First, you need to look at A, then you need to look at B. Once you'ce completed this you need to add C. 

## Closing remarks

This was a fun little project, and the biggest lessons I've learned was that nothig is going to change. There will always be more security vulnerabilities to explore. 

Happy Hacking!
